##ESP8266 practical hardware. Having code is no good if you cannot deploy it...

This repository intends to create instructions how to make safe devices in a practical and economic way.

BUT DO REMEMBER, most of these ideas use MAINS power and YOU should make SURE that YOU are SAFE and follow your local regulations!

I'll start with a few pictures of work done already...

1) Compact 6$ electricity plug ![HKP](https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/HardWare/blob/master/HomeKidPlug/HomeKidPlug.png)
2) Off the shelf dimmable color led lamp ![TYLE1R](https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/HardWare/blob/master/DimmableLEDlamp/DimmableLEDlamp.png)

Code for this lamp is now in [ESP8266-HomeKit-Demo](https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/ESP8266-HomeKit-Demo/tree/master/AiLight)
